_“If the human brain were so simple that we could understand it, we would be so simple that we couldn’t.” ― Emerson M. Pugh_

It is undeniable that the human brain is complicated. But saying this sentence itself is like a contradiction. The human brain is complicated because we are trying to understand it as a human using that complicated brain! In order to surround a concept and fully understand it, we need to be above that.

In the book “The FlatLand” by Edwin A. Abbott, the characters of the story are some 2-dimensional inhabitants on the 2-d page. Imagine you are one of those characters on the 2d page and anything else is also 2d. What you can see is just lines, with shades, and nothing else. you can go around a shape, like a triangle, to see different sides of it, but you can never observe that as what we know as a triangle. To see the typical triangle, you should come out of the page, using the third dimension, and look at it from above.

Now, extend this concept to the brain. We cannot fully understand the human brain until we are in the human brain! We must have, or to put it more correctly, be in a more advanced organ than our brain. Furthermore, we cannot thoroughly comprehend nor predict human behavior, emotions, thoughts, and other abstractions that are counted as social sciences such as history. There will always be some unfillable gaps in the learning and analysis of these topics.

We can also extend this analogy to the whole world! How do we want to fully grasp the world while we are only a part of it?

My assumption here is that the human brain, as a self-conscious organ, is limited, independent of the intelligence of that person. However, you might deny this conclusion if you believe we are special creators on the Earth, and we are not descended from monkeys!

Now let’s look at this problem from a mathematical perspective. Remember the most famous paradox in history, Russell’s Paradox in set theory:

There is no set, including all sets.

The induction is simple. That set cannot include itself, so technically, it is not a set of all sets. Now get back to the human brain. The human brain is not fully comprehensible since it cannot maintain everything about itself in it. To fully understand the brain, something more powerful and at a higher level than the human brain, in terms of understanding and cognitive abilities, is required.

Moreover, I believe one of the reasons for the existence of superstitions, is the unsuccessful effort of humans to explain the world. While people cannot tolerate this inability to learn some things, they try to fill it with fictional yet understandable stories.

To conclude, I believe although all the endeavors of humans over time, since they started studying (in its basic meaning), are toward discovering the reality of this world and “the truth”, they can never fully understand it, regardless of how much they try.
