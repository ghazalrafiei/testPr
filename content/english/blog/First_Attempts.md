### Books
* The Kites — Romain Gary (Translated in Farsi)
    
    Probably the best novel I have ever read. I read it three times or two. I believe it depicts the most pure and real love between two people. It’s in the WWII.

* Lust for Life — Irving Stone (Translated in Farsi)

    Biographical novel of Van Gogh’s life. The confusion of Van Gogh, and at the same time his perseverance in doing his job, reminds me of when I am lost in doing the work I love.

* All the light we cannot see — Anthony Doerr
    
    Has the most beautiful metaphors and literary phrases, in a deep sad story during WWII.

* Dark Psychology

    Teaches you how people can fool you to make you do sth for them or be convinced easily. Facts can be used to spot and be conscious about them. It’s not for using them against people.

* Flatland (Translated in Farsi: پختستان)

### Series
* In Treatment
    Your mind will blow out after watching this!
